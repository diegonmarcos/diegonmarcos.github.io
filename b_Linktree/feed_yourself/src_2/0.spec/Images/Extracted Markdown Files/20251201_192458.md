George's Zucchini Bread
Ingredients:
Method:
3 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp sea salt
11⁄2 cups cane sugar
1 cup vegetable oil, plus more for the pans
3 large eggs
1 tbsp vanilla extract
3 cups grated zucchini, about 2 medium, don't press or squeeze
Preheat the oven to 325°F/160°C and grease 2 loaf pans.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
In another large bowl, whisk together the sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla. Add the grated zucchini and fold to combine.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Fold in the walnuts.
Divide the batter between the prepared pans and sprinkle with walnuts. Bake for 40 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the tops of the loaves spring back to the touch.
