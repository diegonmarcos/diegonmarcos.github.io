# Lemon Cheesecake Variation

> Same creamy cheesecake, but make it citrus! All the tang of lemon with that silky texture. Skip the berries, embrace the zest.

## Changes from Original Recipe

Use the same base recipe as Noa's Cheesecake, but:
- NO berry coulis
- NO vanilla essence
- **INSTEAD:** Add zest of 3 lemons and a bit of lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture (add after the eggs)
- Sprinkle extra lemon zest on top before serving
