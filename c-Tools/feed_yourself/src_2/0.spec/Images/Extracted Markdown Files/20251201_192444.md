Ingredients:
Vale's Chocotorta (The Amazing Cake)
400g Dulce de leche
400g Cream cheese
RECTANGULAR chocolate cookies
Milk (just to dip the cookies in)
Method:
In a bowl, mix the dulce de leche and cream cheese together until it is all combined
In a dish, put a thin layer of the dulce de leche and cream cheese mixture on the bottom so that the first layer of cookies will stick
Dip the cookies in milk and lay them out in the dish (they should cover the entire surface area)
Then, put a layer of the dulce de leche and cream cheese on top of this
Repeat this layering until you fill the dish
Freeze for at least 2 hours (in a working freezer)
