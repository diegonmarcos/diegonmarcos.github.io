# Rice Ma Sheyesh (Special Rice)

> The "whatever you have" rice that somehow always turns out amazing. Caramelized onions, toasted nuts, sweet raisins - it's basically a party in a pot. Three onions per cup of rice is the secret ratio.

*No exact measurements - that's the beauty of it! Ratio: 3 onions per 1 cup rice*

## Ingredients

- Rice (white, or mix with wild rice)
- Onions (3 per cup of rice)
- Garlic cloves, chopped
- Olive oil for frying
- Roughly chopped nuts: pecans, walnuts, almonds, cashews, pine nuts
- Cranberries
- Raisins
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Cumin
- Cinnamon
- Chopped parsley and mint for garnish

## Instructions

1. Fry the onions until caramelized and lightly browned
2. Add the chopped garlic cloves
3. Add the nut mixture, raisins/cranberries, and spices
4. At the same time, cook rice as usual (separately)
5. Combine the rice with the onion-nut mixture
6. Taste and adjust seasoning
7. Maybe call someone else to taste and help fix if something's missing (that's what usually happens!)
8. Garnish with fresh parsley and mint
