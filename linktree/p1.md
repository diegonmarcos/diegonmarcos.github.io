# Reverse Engineering Strategies for linktr.ee/diegonmarcos

Here are two strategies to reverse engineer the website and create an HTML5/CSS3/JS equivalent:

## Strategy 1: Manual Reconstruction

This approach involves manually analyzing the website's front-end code to understand its structure, styling, and behavior.

1.  **Analyze the HTML Structure:** Use browser developer tools to inspect the DOM and understand the hierarchy of elements.
2.  **Examine the CSS:** Identify the key stylesheets and analyze the CSS rules to understand the layout, colors, and fonts.
3.  **Inspect the JavaScript:** Debug the JavaScript code to understand how the website handles user interactions and dynamic content.
4.  **Recreate the Site:** Based on the analysis, create a new HTML5/CSS3/JS project that mimics the original website's design and functionality.

## Strategy 2: Automated Extraction

This strategy uses tools to automatically extract the website's assets and code, which can then be modified and repurposed.

1.  **Download the Website:** Use a tool like HTTrack or Wget to download a copy of the website to your local machine.
2.  **Extract Assets:** Identify and extract the website's images, fonts, and other assets from the downloaded files.
3.  **Analyze and Refactor:** Analyze the downloaded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to understand its structure and functionality.
4.  **Rebuild and Customize:** Create a new project using the extracted assets and code as a starting point, and then customize it to meet your needs.

## Website Analysis

The website `linktr.ee/diegonmarcos` is a simple, single-page site that serves as a personal landing page. Its primary purpose is to consolidate various links to Diego Nepomuceno Marcos's online presence, including contact information, professional profiles, and personal interests.

### Structure and Content

The page is organized into clear, collapsible sections:

*   **Contact:** Direct links to Email, LinkedIn, and Telegram.
*   **Professional:** Links to a professional landpage, curriculum vitae (web and PDF), GitHub, WakaTime, and Substack blogs.
*   **Personal:** A collection of links categorized into Media, Endurance, Maps, Projects, and Others.

This structure makes it easy for visitors to navigate and find the information they are looking for.

### Technology

Linktree pages are typically built with a combination of modern web technologies:

*   **Front-End Framework:** Likely a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js for dynamic content and a smooth user experience.
*   **Styling:** CSS-in-JS libraries or a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS are common for creating the visual design.
*   **Hosting:** The site is hosted on the Linktree platform, which handles the back-end infrastructure and content management.

Recreating this website would be a good exercise in front-end development, focusing on HTML structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the interactive elements (like the collapsible sections).

## Styles and Colors

### Layout
The layout is a single-column, centered design that is optimized for mobile devices. It uses Flexbox for alignment and spacing. The main content area has a maximum width of 580px on larger screens. The gap between the link buttons is 14px.

### Background
The background of the page features a video that plays on a loop. The video is implemented as a set of `url()` values in the `background-image` property of the `ProfileBackground` component. These URLs point to `.webp` files, which are likely animated images that create a video-like effect.

### Colors
The color scheme is based on a dark background with light text and accents. The specific colors are defined using CSS variables:

*   **Background:** `#000` (Black)
*   **Text:** `#FFFFFF` (White)
*   **Buttons:**
    *   **Background:** `transparent`
    *   **Text:** `#FFFFFF` (White)
    *   **Border:** `1px solid #FFFFFF` (White)
*   **Social Icons:** `#ffffff` (White)

### Typography
The typography uses two main fonts:

*   **Headers:** `Archivo Black`
*   **Body:** `Inter`

The font weights are well-defined, with `400` for normal text and `700` for bold. The base font size is `16px`, with larger sizes used for headers.

### Buttons
The buttons have a distinct, modern design:

*   **Shape:** They are pill-shaped with fully rounded corners, defined by a `border-radius` of `28px`.
*   **Style:** The buttons have an "outline" style, meaning they are transparent with a `1px` solid white border.
*   **Interactivity:** On hover, the background color changes slightly to provide visual feedback.
*   **Sizing:** They have a minimum height of `64px` and generous horizontal padding (`44px`), making them easy to interact with, especially on touch devices.

### JavaScript Animations and Interactivity
The website's animations and interactive elements are powered by JavaScript. Here are the key features:

*   **Collapsible Sections:** The page's sections (Contact, Professional, Personal) can be expanded and collapsed. This functionality is managed by JavaScript, which toggles the visibility of the content and animates the height of the sections for a smooth user experience.
*   **Share Functionality:** The share button triggers a JavaScript event to open a share dialog or copy the profile URL to the clipboard.
*   **Lazy Loading:** The site uses lazy loading for images, which means that images are only loaded as they become visible in the viewport. This is a common optimization technique to improve page load times.
*   **Analytics and Tracking:** A significant portion of the JavaScript on the page is dedicated to analytics and user tracking, which is a core feature of the Linktree platform.

## Final Comments for Re-engineering

To create a high-fidelity, re-engineered version of this website, a developer should consider the following:

*   **Framework Choice:** The original site uses a modern JavaScript framework (likely Next.js, a React framework, given the `__next` div). To accurately replicate the component-based architecture and dynamic nature of the site, using a similar framework is highly recommended.

*   **Data Management:** All the profile information, including the links, titles, and even theme colors, is embedded in the initial HTML in a large JSON object within a `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">` tag. A re-engineered version would need to either hardcode this data, load it from a local JSON file, or create a simple backend API to serve it.

*   **Styling Approach:** The site uses a CSS-in-JS approach, where styles are dynamically generated and injected into the document. To replicate this, you could use libraries like Styled Components or Emotion. Alternatively, you could manually extract the CSS rules from the downloaded file and place them in a traditional `.css` stylesheet.

*   **Asset Replication:** The core HTML and styles have been downloaded. The animated `.webp` background files for both mobile and desktop have also been downloaded and are available in the `assets` directory. A complete re-engineering would still require sourcing the profile picture and the various icons used in the buttons. These assets are crucial for achieving the same visual polish as the original.

*   **Interactivity Implementation:** The collapsible sections are a key feature. This would need to be implemented in JavaScript, likely by manipulating the `height` or `max-height` CSS properties with a smooth transition to create the animation effect.

In summary, while the site appears simple on the surface, it is built with modern web technologies. A successful re-engineering project will require a good understanding of JavaScript frameworks, CSS-in-JS, and how to handle dynamic data in a front-end application.
