## Refined CV HTML to A4/PDF Prompt (Addressing OpenOffice/Legacy HTML)

### **Goal:**
Apply the efect of A4 page style over the borderless style of html files

### **The Prompt:**

"I require you to act as an expert **HTML, CSS and JS**.

I am providing an existing HTML document for a Curriculum Vitae that was likely generated by an office suite like OpenOffice. **Acknowledge that this HTML is likely badly formatted, highly dependent on tables for layout, and contains excessive, non-standard, or inline styling/attributes.**

Your task is a comprehensive overhaul: single-file HTML structure that is fully optimized for printing as an **A4-sized PDF**.

There are two models(The header with Diego Nepomuceno Marcos indicate both starts) of CV both with two pages, what makes this a "PDF" of 4 pages.

Make sure to not make any change on the layou, formating. You will only apply the A4 page layout with the pages breaks!!

### **Specific Instructions for Code Remediation & Print Optimization:**

1.  **Code Sanitation (Crucial):**

2.  **Modern Layout & Styling:**

    * The document's default print layout must be constrained to the dimensions of an **A4 page** (approximately $210 \text{ mm} \times 297 \text{ mm}$). Use the **International System of Units** (specifically $\text{mm}$ or $\text{cm}$).
    * Apply standard print margins (e.g., $15 \text{ mm}$ to $20 \text{ mm}$ on all sides) using CSS `@page` rules or `body` margins.

3.  **Page Break Handling:**
    * The original HTML contains specific markers indicating a desired page break. **Locate and replace the element containing the exact text string 'Annotations: Page Break'** (case-insensitive) with a neutral, semantic element (e.g., `<div class="page-break-indicator">`).
    * Apply the CSS rule `page-break-after: always;` (or the modern `break-after: page;`) to the `.page-break-indicator` class to force a new page for PDF generation.
    * Ensure large content blocks (like entire CV sections) use `page-break-inside: avoid;` to prevent headings from being isolated at the bottom of a page.
