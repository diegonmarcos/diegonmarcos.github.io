After 20 mins, let the mixture cool down till it's room temp but not hot (still warm, give it like 5-10 mins)
Once it's cooled, add the mustard and a generous amount of salt and pepper and the
cheese
Mix that nicely, the cheese shouldn't melt with it, but it might go a little bit melty so it all clumps together
Method for final steps:
Take the pastry out the fridge
Split it % and 3 - the % will be the base of the pie and the 3 will be the lid
Grease a dish, roll out the pastry, put the pastry in the dish. Have the top of the pastry
kind of peeking over the top of the dish
Fill this with your filling
Roll out the top and put the pastry 'lid' on
Make sure the dish is fully covered otherwise it might not cook properly
Pinch the excess pastry into the lid of the pie and then take a fork and press it against
the sides of the crust all the way around
Egg wash the top of the pie
Cook for 20-30 mins at 180
