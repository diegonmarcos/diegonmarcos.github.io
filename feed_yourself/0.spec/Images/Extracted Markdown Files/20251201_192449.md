# Noa's Cheesecake

> A proper Aussie-style cheesecake with biscuit base and berry coulis on top. The secret is letting it cool in the oven with the door ajar - it creates the perfect dip for berries. Refrigerate overnight if you can resist.

## Ingredients

### Base
- 160g Arnott's Milk Arrowroot biscuits (or similar cookies)
- 60g+ butter, melted

### Filling
- 350g cream cheese (Philadelphia), softened for 30 mins
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- A fat dash of vanilla essence
- 1 tbsp plain or tapioca flour
