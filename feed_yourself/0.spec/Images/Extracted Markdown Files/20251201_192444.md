# Vale's Chocotorta

> The legendary Argentinian no-bake cake that's dangerously easy to make. Layers of milk-soaked cookies and dulce de leche cream cheese. Your freezer is about to become your best friend.

## Ingredients

- 400g dulce de leche
- 400g cream cheese
- Rectangular chocolate cookies (lots of them!)
- Milk (for dipping)

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, mix dulce de leche and cream cheese until fully combined
2. In a dish, spread a thin layer of the mixture on the bottom (so cookies stick)
3. Dip cookies in milk and lay them out to cover the entire surface
4. Spread a layer of dulce de leche mixture on top of the cookies
5. Repeat: dipped cookies, then cream layer, then cookies...
6. Continue until you fill the dish (end with cream layer on top)
7. Freeze for at least 2 hours (in a working freezer - yes, this matters!)
8. Slice and serve cold
9. Try not to eat the whole thing in one sitting
