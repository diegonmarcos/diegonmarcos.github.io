# Algorithmic Art

Create generative and algorithmic art using p5.js. Supports seeded randomness for reproducibility, particle systems, fractals, Perlin noise, and creative coding patterns. Outputs as HTML with embedded canvas.

## Example Prompts

- "Generate a fractal tree animation with autumn colors"
- "Create a Perlin noise flow field with particle trails"
- "Make a generative art piece using recursive geometric patterns"
- "Build an interactive particle system that responds to mouse movement"
