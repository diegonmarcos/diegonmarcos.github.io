Pies
Pies are always fun, I will start with the recipe for the dough and then I will add different options for the fillings. It's a flexible recipe and feel free to improvise, enjoy!
For dough: (one round pan)
200 grams of flour (a cup and a half minus a tablespoon or so)
100 grams of very cold butter, cut into cubes
a little salt
egg
2-3 tablespoons of cold water

In a bowl, crumble the butter together with the flour and salt until a sand-like texture
is obtained, (if you have a food processor it is possible and even better to prepare the whole dough in it...). You should work with the dough as little as possible, because we don't want to melt the butter.
Add the egg, a little water (better gradually, the amount of water varies depending on the weather and the flour).
Knead a little until a uniform ball of dough is formed.
Flour a surface, roll out the dough and transfer it to a pan greased with butter.
Line the dough nicely inside the mold, also in the corners and tighten it to the sides. Pierce the bottom with a fork and put it in the freezer for at least half an hour.
After it has cooled completely, I usually put the dough in an initial oven (180 degrees Celsius), fifteen minutes to twenty minutes, until it is lightly golden. If the filling you chose is not very liquid, you can skip this step, but it keeps the dough crispy and fun.
