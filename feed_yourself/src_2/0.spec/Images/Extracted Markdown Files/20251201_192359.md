(I tried to quantify the ratios, usually I do it by eye if there is any difficulty talk to me!)
Method:
In a deep pan, fry the onion until lightly golden. Add the carrots. After a few minutes, add the rice, lentils, quinoa, cranberries, pine nuts, pomegranate concentrate, silan, and spices. Let the filling sizzle a little and then add the green mixture and the lemon zest. Pour a little olive oil in a wide pot.
To start the filling process, peel off the outer layer, make a small cut along the onion so that the layers can be separated. Fill each layer separately (about a teaspoon or so of filling, depending on the size of the onion). Close well and put in a pot. We will arrange them tightly so that they do not open during cooking.
We'll pour silan over them, cut cherry tomatoes into quarters and place them nicely between the onions, garnish with mint and sprinkle some salt and black pepper on top. We will pour the sauce ingredients over our beautiful onions, and we will transfer the covered pot for initial cooking on the stove (after boiling we will change to a small flame), for forty minutes.
Then put the covered pot in the oven for another hour, with a temperature of 150 degrees Celsius. After an hour, give the onions a heat stroke (we will explain how to do this now) - take the lid off the pot and raise the oven temperature to 220. After fifteen minutes we will take out.
