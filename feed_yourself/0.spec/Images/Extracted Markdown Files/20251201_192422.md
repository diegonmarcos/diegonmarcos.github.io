# George's Great Potato Mash

> The mashed potatoes that broke the internet (okay, maybe just the dinner table). Creamy, garlicky, oniony perfection. Trust your tongue and intuition - George would approve.

*Disclaimer: No exact recipe exists. Let your instincts guide you. Do not stray from what calls you.*

## Ingredients

- 1 bag potatoes (~10-15 medium spuds)
- 400-500g white cheese or sour cream (to taste)
- 4 stalks green onions
- 6-8 tbsp butter
- 3/4 - 1 cup milk
- Salt (generous!)
- Pepper (generous!)
- 1 head of garlic (adjust for garlic tendencies and fear)

## Instructions

1. Wash potatoes, cut off eyes and blemishes (leave skins on!)
2. Peel and separate garlic cloves
3. Chop potatoes into chunks
4. Add garlic and potato chunks to a large pot
5. Cover with hot water, add generous handful of salt
6. Boil until a fork slides in easily
7. Meanwhile, chop green onion stalks into thin rings - set aside
8. In a small pot, combine butter, milk, salt and pepper
9. Stir on medium-low until butter melts and ingredients combine
10. Drain potatoes and mash in the same pot until smooth
11. Slowly add white cheese, mixing until well incorporated
12. Add butter-milk mixture the same way
13. Fold in the reserved green onions
14. Serve with your favorite gravy!

*For Laudae and Reuben's "True British" version: add one whole raw potato, attempt to mash, fail miserably. Do not consume. "No one will notice, potatoes don't even need cooking" - they said.*
