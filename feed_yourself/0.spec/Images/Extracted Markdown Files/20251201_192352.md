## Instructions

### Prepare the Zucchini

2. Fry onion until lightly browned
3. Add rice and fry for another 4 minutes
4. Add carrot, herbs, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt and plenty of black pepper
5. Taste and adjust salt (even though rice is still hard)
6. Let the filling cool completely

### Stuff and Cook
1. Fill zucchini almost to the end
2. Arrange in a wide, shallow pot
3. If filling is left over, hollow out tomatoes and stuff them too - wonderful with zucchini!
4. Mix all sauce ingredients and pour over zucchini (sauce should cover them)
5. Bring to boil, lower flame, cover and cook 40 minutes
6. Heat oven to 150°C
7. Put covered pot in oven for 1 hour
8. Remove lid, increase to 220°C
