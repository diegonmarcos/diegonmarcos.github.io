Ingredients:
Mangold (chard) and eggplant fritters
•
Peeled and diced medium eggplant
•
Method:
A bunch of mangold/ chard, roughly chopped without the hard white part
grated carrot
grated zucchini
Grated potato
Onion cut into tiny cubes
Finely chopped herbs, whichever you like (parsley, mint, basil, oregano)
Hot spices: a teaspoon of turmeric, a teaspoon of cumin, a teaspoon of salt, a quarter teaspoon of black pepper, half a teaspoon of paprika
Crushed garlic clove
3 tablespoons of olive oil
Half a cup of bread crumbs
2 eggs (optional, if you want it to be vegan you can add more flour, or make a quick puree that will stick to the mixture)
2 tablespoons of chickpea/wheat/lentil flour
Cook the mangold/chard and eggplant in a pot of boiling water until soft. Put in a
strainer for about half an hour to drain excess liquid, then chop the vegetable flesh with a knife.
Squeeze the grated carrot and zucchini well from all the liquid with your hands.
In a large bowl, mix all the vegetables, add the spices and eggs, add flour and breadcrumbs.
We will make beautiful balls on a tray, put in the refrigerator for half an hour
Fry in a hot pan with deep oil until golden.
If you want to bake in the oven - brush a little olive oil on a baking paper, place the balls
nicely on the pan and brush a little more olive oil on top of them. Bake at high heat until golden.
