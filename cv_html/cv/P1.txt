## ðŸš€ Refined CV HTML to A4/PDF Prompt (Addressing OpenOffice/Legacy HTML)

### **Goal:**
Transform poorly formatted, table-heavy HTML (likely from an office suite like OpenOffice), into a clean, modern, single-file HTML document fully optimized for A4-sized PDF printing, with correct page breaks based on specific annotations.

***

### **The Prompt:**

"I require you to act as an expert **HTML5, CSS3, and legacy code remediation specialist**.

I am providing an existing HTML document for a Curriculum Vitae that was likely generated by an office suite like OpenOffice. **Acknowledge that this HTML is likely badly formatted, highly dependent on tables for layout, and contains excessive, non-standard, or inline styling/attributes.**

Your task is a comprehensive overhaul: refactor this code into a clean, single-file HTML5 structure that is fully optimized for printing as an **A4-sized PDF**.

### **Specific Instructions for Code Remediation & Print Optimization:**

1.  **Code Sanitation (Crucial):**
    * **Strip all inline styles** (i.e., `style="..."` attributes) and deprecated HTML presentation attributes (e.g., `width`, `height`, `border`, `bgcolor`, `align`, `cellpadding`, `cellspacing`).
    * **Simplify the DOM:** Remove or consolidate excessive wrapping elements, such as multiple nested `<div>` or redundant `<table>` structures, converting presentational table usage into modern, semantic structures.

2.  **Modern Layout & Styling:**
    * **All styling must be contained internally** within a `<style>` block in the HTML document's `<head>`.
    * **Convert table-based layouts to modern CSS** (Flexbox or CSS Grid) for any non-tabular content (like two-column CV sections) to ensure predictable and robust behavior during print. Only retain `<table>` for actual data tables (if any).
    * The document's default print layout must be constrained to the dimensions of an **A4 page** (approximately $210 \text{ mm} \times 297 \text{ mm}$). Use the **International System of Units** (specifically $\text{mm}$ or $\text{cm}$).
    * Apply standard print margins (e.g., $15 \text{ mm}$ to $20 \text{ mm}$ on all sides) using CSS `@page` rules or `body` margins.

3.  **Page Break Handling:**
    * The original HTML contains specific markers indicating a desired page break. **Locate and replace the element containing the exact text string 'Annotations: Page Break'** (case-insensitive) with a neutral, semantic element (e.g., `<div class="page-break-indicator">`).
    * Apply the CSS rule `page-break-after: always;` (or the modern `break-after: page;`) to the `.page-break-indicator` class to force a new page for PDF generation.
    * Ensure large content blocks (like entire CV sections) use `page-break-inside: avoid;` to prevent headings from being isolated at the bottom of a page.

4.  **Aesthetics:**
    * Apply a clean, professional, and highly readable sans-serif typeface.
    * Ensure appropriate font sizes, spacing, and use of visual hierarchy (headings, bolding) to match the professional quality expected of a Curriculum Vitae, referencing a standard CV PDF design.

**Input Data:**

* **HTML to be Refactored:** \[Insert the full, existing OpenOffice-generated HTML code here]
* **Reference PDF:** (The final HTML/CSS must create a professional print-ready design that is visually comparable to a clean, multi-page CV PDF.)

**Output Format:**

* Provide the **complete, single-file HTML5 code** with the cleaned structure and all internal CSS, ready for immediate saving and printing to PDF."
