## Instructions

### Make the Filling
1. In a deep pan, fry the cubed onion until lightly golden

6. Mix well

### Prepare and Fill the Onions
1. Pour a little olive oil in a wide pot
2. Peel off the outer layer of the cooked onions
3. Make a small cut along each onion so layers can be separated
4. Fill each layer separately (about 1 teaspoon of filling per layer)
5. Close well and place in pot
6. Arrange tightly so they don't open during cooking

### Assemble and Cook
1. Pour silan over the stuffed onions
2. Cut cherry tomatoes into quarters, place between onions
3. Garnish with mint, sprinkle salt and pepper
4. Pour sauce ingredients over everything
5. Cover pot and bring to boil on stove
