### Assets
\--v How to apply A4 PDF style and page breaks to HTML

Applying the dimensions and visual style of an **A4 PDF** to **HTML** is primarily achieved through **CSS** and is generally aimed at making a web page look correct when **printed** or converted to a PDF. The most effective approach involves using **CSS Paged Media** rules, specifically the `@page` at-rule, and the `page-break-*` properties (or their newer `break-*` equivalents) for page breaks.

# Strategy
## üìè A4 Dimensions and Style Approach

The standard A4 paper size is **$210 \text{ mm}$ by $297 \text{ mm}$**. You can enforce these dimensions and control margins using the **`@page`** CSS rule, which is specifically designed for styling printed documents. üìÑ

### 1\. Define A4 Size and Margins with `@page`

Use the `@page` rule to set the paper size and overall page margins for the printed output. Remember to use **millimetres ($\text{mm}$)** as requested.

```css
@media print {
  @page {
    /* Set the size to A4 */
    size: A4; 
    /* Or you can specify dimensions directly in mm */
    /* size: 210mm 297mm; */ 
    
    /* Set global page margins */
    margin: 20mm; 
  }
  
  /* Optional: Make the body content fit within the A4 print area */
  body {
    width: 210mm;
    margin: 0 auto; /* Center the content */
    padding: 0;
    /* Other print-specific styles */
  }
  
  /* Hide elements that shouldn't appear in print (e.g., navigation) */
  .no-print {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```

### 2\. Styling for Print (`@media print`)

Always wrap your A4-specific styles within an **`@media print`** query. This ensures these rules only apply when the user attempts to print the document, leaving the screen display untouched.

```css
@media print {
  /* All your print-specific styles go here */
  h1 {
    font-size: 16pt; /* Use points (pt) for print text sizing */
  }
  /* ... more styles to match a formal PDF look ... */
}
```

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Page Break Approaches

To control exactly where one A4 page ends and the next begins, you use **page break properties**.

### 1\. `page-break-*` (Legacy/Widely Supported)

These are the older, but most widely supported properties for forcing and preventing breaks. They are applied to the element *before* or *after* which you want the break to occur.

  * **To force a break before an element:**
    ```css
    .new-chapter {
      page-break-before: always;
    }
    ```
  * **To force a break after an element:**
    ```css
    .section-end {
      page-break-after: always;
    }
    ```
  * **To prevent a break inside an element** (e.g., keeping a table row or an image with its caption together):
    ```css
    .keep-together {
      page-break-inside: avoid;
    }
    ```

### 2\. `break-*` (Modern Standard)

The newer, standardized properties replace the `page-break-*` properties and are part of the CSS Fragmentation Module. While they are the future standard, **browser support for printing can still be inconsistent**, so many developers still use the legacy properties or both for maximum compatibility.

  * **To force a break before an element:**
    ```css
    .new-chapter {
      break-before: page;
    }
    ```
  * **To prevent a break inside an element:**
    ```css
    .keep-together {
      break-inside: avoid-page;
    }
    ```

**Recommendation:** For the best compatibility across browsers when printing, **use the `page-break-*` properties** inside your `@media print` block. ‚öôÔ∏è
