BREADS
Laudae's Challah
Ingredients:
Method:
-
2 tablespoons of yeast
3 cups of warm water
1 tablespoon of sugar + 1⁄2 cup of sugar Pinch of salt
1⁄2 cup vegetable oil (canola or olive)
1 large whisked egg + 1 egg for the glaze Flour (do it to the texture)
Put the warm water in a bowl, add the tablespoon of sugar and add the table spoons of yeast. Sprinkle the sugar and the yeast over the water so it's evenly distributed Let the yeast activate - this takes roughly 10 minutes, but if it takes less or more time that's okay too. The yeast is active then it becomes fluffy and bubbly on top. Add the oil, sugar, salt and the egg and whisk it together.
Slowly start to add flour while you're mixing. You want the consistency to be a 'shaggy dough.' If you're making challah for 20 people, you will use about a bag to a bag and a half of flour.
Flour a surface and knead the dough. Knead until it's springy. Let it sit for 2 hours
Braid as you wish and coat with the egg glaze (and whatever else you want to decorate with).
Let the braided bread rise for about a half an hour (don't let it grow too much, but you do want it to have grown before you put it into the oven).
Preheat the oven to 220, and then cook for 10 minutes at 220 and 20 minutes at 180 (turn the oven down after 10 minutes).
