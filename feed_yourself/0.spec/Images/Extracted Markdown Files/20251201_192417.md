Rice Ma Sheyesh/ special rice:
* I don't have exact amounts for this recipe, except that for every cup of rice I usually put three
onions.
Ingredients:
Rice (white or you can combine wild rice)
Onion
Chopped garlic cloves
Olive oil for frying
Roughly chopped nuts - pecans, walnuts, almonds, cashews and pine nuts if available cranberries
raisins
Spices - salt, black pepper, cumin, cinnamon
• Chopped parsley and mint for decoration on top
Method:
Fry the onion until caramelized and lightly browned. Add the chopped garlic cloves, the mixture of nuts and raisins and the spices.
At the same time we will prepare rice as usual.
We will mix, taste, adjust the seasoning, maybe call someone else to taste as well and fix it accordingly if something is missing. At least that's what usually happens to me.
