# Canvas Design

Two-step design process: 1) Create a design philosophy/aesthetic movement (4-6 paragraphs), 2) Express it visually. 90% visual, 10% text. Museum/magazine quality with expert craftsmanship. Subtle conceptual references, not literal.

## Example Prompts

- "Design a poster for a jazz festival in a mid-century modern style"
- "Create a visual identity card inspired by Bauhaus principles"
- "Make an abstract composition exploring the theme of urban solitude"
- "Design a magazine cover with a bold typographic treatment"
