## Repository Structure

### Directory Organization Principles

The project follows a numbered directory structure for better organization and clarity:

- **0.spec/** - Specifications and documentation (e.g., spec.md, spec_ops.md)
- **1.ops/** - Operations scripts and build tools (e.g., build.sh)
- **2.assets/** - Static assets like images, icons, and media files
- **3.sass/** - Sass/SCSS source files
- **4.jenkyls/** - Jekyll configuration and templates (where applicable)

This structure is applied consistently across the root and subdirectories (cv_web, cv_pdf, linktree).

### Key Files & Directories

#### Root Level
- `index.html` - Portfolio landing page
- `style.css` - Compiled CSS (generated from Sass)
- `script.js` - Features: Clippy assistant, space background, scroll animations
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and build scripts
- `.gitignore` - Excludes: video files, build artifacts, symlinks

#### Organized Directories
- `/0.spec/` - Specification and documentation files (spec.md, spec_ops.md)
- `/1.ops/` - Operations scripts (build.sh for Sass compilation and deployment)
- `/2.assets/` - Media files (images, icons, videos)
- `/3.sass/` - Sass source files following ITCSS architecture

#### Sass Source Files (`/3.sass`)
```
/3.sass
â”œâ”€â”€ abstracts/          # Variables, mixins, functions (no CSS output)
â”œâ”€â”€ base/               # Foundation styles (reset, typography)
â”œâ”€â”€ layout/             # Major structural components (header, sections)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/         # Reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, clippy)
â”œâ”€â”€ themes/             # Theme variations (dark, light)
â”œâ”€â”€ utilities/          # Helpers, animations, media queries
â””â”€â”€ style.scss          # Master import file (ITCSS methodology)
```

#### Blog Directory (`/blog`)
```
/blog
â”œâ”€â”€ _config.yml              # Jekyll configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ _layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.html         # Dark theme HTML template
â””â”€â”€ index.md                 # Blog content (converted to HTML by Jekyll)
```

#### Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
- `deploy.yml` - Main deployment pipeline
- `jekyll-deploy.yml.disabled` - Deprecated workflow (kept for reference)

## Build and Operations (1.ops)

The `1.ops/` directory centralizes all build tools, scripts, and configurations, abstracting the operational aspects of the project from the source code.

### Folder Structure

```
1.ops/
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ script.js.map         # Source map for debugging TypeScript
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css.map         # Source map for debugging Sass
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/             # Node.js dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ build.sh              # (Example) Build script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ push.sh               # (Example) Deployment script
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ s.sh                  # (Example) Utility script
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json              # npm dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json         # Exact versions of dependencies
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json             # TypeScript compiler options
```

### Key Files

*   **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, dependencies (like `sass`, `typescript`, `concurrently`), and a set of npm scripts to automate common tasks.
*   **`tsconfig.json`**: Configures the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). It specifies the root files, output directory, and compiler options like `sourceMap` and `outDir`.
*   **`logs/`**: Contains build artifacts that are useful for debugging but not essential for the final product, such as source maps (`.map` files).

### NPM Scripts

The `package.json` file contains the following scripts for managing the build process:

*   `npm run sass:build`: Compiles the main Sass file (`3.sass/style.scss`) into `style.css` and moves the source map to `1.ops/logs/`.
*   `npm run ts:build`: Compiles the main TypeScript file (`4.ts/script.ts`) into `script.js` and moves the source map to `1.ops/logs/`.
*   `npm run build`: Runs both `sass:build` and `ts:build` to create a full production build.
*   `npm run sass:watch`: Watches for changes in the Sass files and automatically recompiles them.
*   `npm run ts:watch`: Watches for changes in the TypeScript files and automatically recompiles them.
*   `npm run watch:all`: Runs both `sass:watch` and `ts:watch` concurrently for a seamless development workflow.

## Deployment Pipeline

### Workflow: `deploy.yml`

This workflow automates the build and deployment of the entire static site. It is triggered on every push to the `main` branch.

### Conditional Build Logic ("Makefile" Style)

To improve efficiency and speed up deployment times, the workflow incorporates a conditional, "Makefile-like" logic. It ensures that build steps (like compiling Sass or TypeScript) only run if relevant source files have actually changed in the push. This prevents unnecessary work.

**Core Mechanism:**

1.  **Fetch Git History**: The `actions/checkout@v4` step uses `fetch-depth: 0` to retrieve the full Git history for the branch.

2.  **Detect Changes**: The `tj-actions/changed-files` action is used to get a list of all files that were modified in the push. It does this by running a `git diff` between the commit SHA before the push and the commit SHA after the push.

3.  **Conditional Execution**: Each build step (Sass, TypeScript, Jekyll) has an `if` condition that checks the output of the `changed-files` action. The step is only executed if the list of changed files contains a path to its corresponding source directory.

**Example: Conditional TypeScript Build**

The following snippet from `deploy.yml` shows how the TypeScript compilation step is skipped if no `.ts` files have changed:

```yaml
- name: ðŸ“œ Build JS from TypeScript
  # This step only runs if a file inside '4.ts/' was changed
  if: steps.changed-files.outputs.any_changed && contains(steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files, '4.ts/')
  run: |
    echo "ðŸ“œ Building TypeScript..."
    cd 1.ops
    npm install
    npm run ts:build
    cd ..
    echo "âœ… script.js created"
```

This approach provides the efficiency of a traditional Makefile within the event-driven model of GitHub Actions, saving time and computational resources on each deployment.

### Deployment URL
- Production: `https://diegonmarcos.github.io/`
- Blog: `https://diegonmarcos.github.io/blog/`

## Git Operations

### Tracked Files Policy

#### Excluded from Git (`.gitignore`)
```gitignore
# Symlinks
markdown/

# Jekyll artifacts
_site/
.jekyll-cache/
Gemfile.lock

# Build directories
blog_output/
final_site/

# Video files (prevent bloat)
*.mp4
*.mov
*.avi
*.webm
*.mkv

# Google Drive formats
*.gdoc
*.gsheet
*.gslides
```

#### Repository Size Optimization
- **Before optimization**: 227 MB (including .git history with videos)
- **After optimization**: ~42 MB deployed site
- **Key exclusion**: `.git` directory (189 MB) not deployed
- **Video files**: Untracked from Git but still deployed

### Branch Strategy
- **Main branch**: Production-ready code
- **Direct commits**: Development happens on main (single-developer workflow)

---

## Workflows

### Jekyll Blog Workflow: Local Development and Deployment

This workflow separates local development from the automated deployment process.

#### **Local Development**

For writing and previewing blog posts locally.

1.  **Edit Content**: Modify or create Markdown (`.md`) files inside the `/blog` directory.
2.  **Build HTML (Optional but Recommended)**: Run the build script to generate the HTML files locally. This is the same command the GitHub workflow uses.
    ```bash
    cd blog
    ./build.sh build
    ```
3.  **Preview Site Live (Optional)**: To see your changes in a live-reloading local server:
    ```bash
    cd blog
    ./build.sh serve
    # Visit http://localhost:4000 to preview the blog
    ```
    **Note**: The `serve` command is for local preview only and is **not** used in the deployment workflow.

#### **Deployment Process**

Deployment is fully automated via GitHub Actions on every push to the `main` branch.

1.  **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes. You can choose whether or not to include the locally generated HTML files. The `.gitignore` is configured to allow them, but the workflow will regenerate them regardless to ensure consistency.
    ```bash
    # Example: Commit only the markdown source
    git add blog/index.md
    git commit -m "Update blog post"
    git push origin main
    ```
2.  **Automatic Deployment**: The push triggers the `deploy.yml` workflow, which builds the blog HTML, assembles the full site, and deploys it to GitHub Pages as described in the "Deployment Pipeline" section.

### File Management: Side-by-Side HTML

-   The `build.sh` script places the generated `.html` file directly next to its `.md` source file in the `blog/` directory.
-   **Benefit**: This makes it clear which HTML file corresponds to which Markdown file and allows the generated site to be browsed directly in the repository if desired.
-   The deployment workflow ensures only the final HTML is published to the live site.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures

**Issue**: Exit code 1 during deployment
- **Cause**: Large files or .git directory being uploaded
- **Solution**: Verify `.gitignore` excludes unnecessary files
- **Check**: Workflow copies only necessary directories

**Issue**: Jekyll build fails
- **Cause**: Missing front matter in blog/index.md
- **Solution**: Ensure YAML front matter exists:
  ```yaml
  ---
  layout: default
  title: Title
  ---
  ```

#### Git Operations

**Issue**: Repository too large
- **Cause**: Video files tracked in Git history
- **Solution**:
  ```bash
  git rm --cached path/to/videos/*.mp4
  git add .gitignore
  git commit -m "Stop tracking video files"
  ```

**Issue**: Symlink errors
- **Cause**: Local symlinks (e.g., `markdown/`) pushed to repo
- **Solution**: Add to `.gitignore` and remove from tracking:
  ```bash
  git rm --cached markdown
  ```

#### Deployment Issues

**Issue**: Blog not displaying
- **Cause**: Jekyll not processing Markdown
- **Solution**: Verify `_config.yml` and `_layouts/default.html` exist in `/blog`

**Issue**: Static files missing
- **Cause**: Not copied in workflow
- **Solution**: Check `deploy.yml` "Copy Static Files" step includes directory
