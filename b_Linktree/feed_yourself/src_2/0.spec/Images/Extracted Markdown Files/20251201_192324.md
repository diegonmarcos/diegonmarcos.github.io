A pinch of nutmeg 150 grams of feta
Fry the garlic cloves, the onion and simmer on medium-low heat until the onion turns
a honey color. This process requires time and patience!
We will place the onion mixture on the frozen dough (for this filling there is no need for initial baking), and we will pour the rest of the stuffing on it. Put in an oven preheated to 200 degrees Celsius, and bake for about 40 minutes.
