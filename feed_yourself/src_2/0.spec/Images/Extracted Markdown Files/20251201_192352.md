Method:
Empty the zucchini nicely - this is the hard part. In Sha'arla I prepare with small zucchinis that are meant for filling, I cut the ends and empty the zucchinis leaving one end closed. Don't scrape all the way through with the spoon!
Heat a deep pan with olive oil and fry the onion until lightly browned. Add the rice and continue frying for another 4 minutes +-. Add the carrot, herbs, juice and lemon zest, salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Taste even if the rice is hard and add if there is no salt. Chill (make cold).
Fill the zucchini almost to the end
Arrange however we like in a wide and shallow pot. If there is some filling and space left, we will empty tomatoes and fill them as well. A wonderful match for zucchini!
Mix all the sauce ingredients and pour over the zucchini (the sauce should cover the zucchini).
Bring the pot to a boil, lower the flame, cover and cook for 40 minutes.
Heat the oven to 150 degrees.
Put the covered pot in the oven for an hour. Remove the lid and increase the oven temperature to 220 degrees. Let cook for another quarter of an hour uncovered.
