  1. **"🛠️ Skill List Professional Projects"** (MD line 510) - ✅ Already added to HTML
  2. **"🛠️ Skills List Educational Projects"** (MD line 571) - ❌ Currently titled "🛠️ Hard Skills" in HTML

## 📝 NOTES

1. **Major Progress:** All critical P0 items from original analysis are complete! The HTML now has proper structure with Skills Tables, updated sections, and fixed collapsible hierarchy.

2. **Important Organizational Structure:** The SKILLS section should have TWO parallel "Skill List" subsections:
   - **"Skill List Professional Projects"** ✅ (already added) - Shows skills from actual work projects
   - **"Skills List Educational Projects"** ❌ (currently titled "Hard Skills") - Shows skills from educational background

   Additionally, "My Stack" should have a collapsible "Icons" subheading to organize the icon tables.

3. **New Changes in MD:** The index.md file was updated with a more complex mindmap structure. This is the main remaining update needed.

4. **Structure Philosophy:** MD uses a more academic/CV style with blockquotes and nested lists. HTML uses collapsible sections with formatted content. The divergence is intentional for different mediums.

5. **Mermaid Diagrams:** The new nested mindmap structure will need testing to ensure Mermaid.js library version is compatible.

6. **Responsive Design:** New tables (Skills tables) are now implemented and will need responsive design testing on mobile devices.
