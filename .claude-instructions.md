# Claude Code Agent Instructions

This document provides project-specific guidelines for the Claude Code agent.

## Onboarding and Context

1.  **Initial Context Check:** Before starting any task, verify if you have existing context about this project.
2.  **Default Onboarding:** If no context is available, your first action must be to read the `spec.md` file to understand the project's architecture and features.
3.  **Confirmation:** After reading the specification, confirm that you are ready to proceed.

## Development Workflow

-   **Specification Updates:** All new features, enhancements, or significant changes must be documented in the `spec.md` file. Ensure the documentation is added to the relevant section.
-   **Task Management:** Use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track multi-step tasks for better visibility and organization.
-   **Code Quality:** Follow existing code patterns and style conventions in the project.

## Communication

-   **Conciseness:** Keep responses short and to the point, appropriate for CLI display.
-   **File References:** Use the pattern `file_path:line_number` when referencing specific code locations.
-   **No Emojis:** Avoid using emojis unless explicitly requested.

## Version Control

-   **Commits:** Only create commits when explicitly requested by the user.
-   **Commit Messages:** Follow the existing commit message style in the repository.
-   **Pull Requests:** Include specification updates in PRs when features are added or modified.
