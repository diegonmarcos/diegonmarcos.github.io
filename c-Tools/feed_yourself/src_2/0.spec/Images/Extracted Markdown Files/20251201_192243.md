Ingredients:
• 250g basmati rice
375ml boiling water
Rice & Chickpea Salad
•
21⁄2 tbsp olive oil
• 2 tsp cumin (seeds are better but if you don't have, just the powder)
11⁄2 tsp curry powder
⚫ 240g cooked chickpeas
•
180ml sunflower oil
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1⁄2 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp parsley and coriander (but we usually use more, use as much as you want) Salt and black pepper
Method:
Pour a tbsp of olive oil into a pan with a tight fitting lid and put on high heat. Add the rice and a 1/4 tsp of salt and stir as the rice warms up. Add the boiling water and reduce the heat to very low. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 15 mins. Remove the pan from the heat and cover with a clean towel (if you can find one... oops), and then the lid. Leave this aside for about 10 mins.
Heat remaining olive oil on high heat - add the cumin and curry powder. Then add the chickpeas and a 1⁄4 tsp of salt (do this quickly and don't let the spices burn in the oil). Stir on heat for a minute or two (just to heat up the chickpeas), and then transfer to a big mixing bowl.
Pour the sunflower oil into a pan on high heat. Make sure the oil is hot by throwing in a piece of onion (it should sizzle??). Then, use your hands to mix the onion with the flour to coat it. Take some onion and place it in the oil, fry for 2-3 mins, until golden, and then transfer to a paper towel and sprinkle with salt. Repeat in batches until all the onion is fried.
Add the rice, herbs and fried onions to the chickpeas. Stir, and add salt and pepper as needed. Serve warm or at room temperature.
