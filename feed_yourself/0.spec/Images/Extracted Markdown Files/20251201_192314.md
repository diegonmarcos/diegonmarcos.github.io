## Final Assembly Steps

1. After 20 mins of cooking filling, let mixture cool to room temp (still warm, about 5-10 mins)
2. Once cooled, add the mustard and a generous amount of salt and pepper
3. Add the cheese and mix nicely - cheese shouldn't melt completely, just clump together
4. Take the pastry out of the fridge
5. Split it 2/3 and 1/3 - the 2/3 will be the base, 1/3 will be the lid
6. Grease a dish, roll out the pastry, put in the dish with edges peeking over the top
7. Fill with your filling
8. Roll out the top and put the pastry "lid" on
9. Make sure the dish is fully covered (otherwise it won't cook properly)
10. Pinch the excess pastry into the lid, then press a fork against the sides all around
11. Egg wash the top
12. Cook for 20-30 mins at 180°C

*Note: This quantity serves 20 people!*
