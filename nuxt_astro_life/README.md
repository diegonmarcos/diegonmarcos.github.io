## 🎯 How It Works

The application uses a **deterministic seed-based algorithm** to generate consistent astrology data based on:
- Name
- Birth date
- Birth time
- Birth location

This ensures the same inputs always produce the same results, creating a personalized experience.

### Fixed Issues from React Version

✅ **Generate Button Fixed**: Properly handles form submission with `@submit.prevent`
✅ **City Selection Fixed**: Dropdown works correctly with v-model
✅ **TypeScript Safety**: All types are properly defined
✅ **Reactive State**: Uses Vue's reactivity system correctly
✅ **Component Lifecycle**: Proper cleanup in onUnmounted

### 3D Globe

The interactive globe is powered by Three.js and shows:
- Planetary lines (astrocartography)
- City markers for power locations
- Auto-rotation for a dynamic view
- Mobile-friendly touch interactions

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding More Cities

Edit `CITIES_DB` in `composables/useAstroData.ts`:

```typescript
export const CITIES_DB: City[] = [
  { name: "Your City, Country", lat: 0.0000, lng: 0.0000 },
  // ...
];
```

### Customizing Planets

Modify `PLANETS` array in `composables/useAstroData.ts`:

```typescript
export const PLANETS: Planet[] = [
  {
    id: 'sun',
    name: 'Sun',
    symbol: '☉',
    color: 0xfbbf24,
    cssColor: '#fbbf24',
    question: "Who am I?"
  },
  // ...
];
```

### Styling

- **Tailwind Classes**: Modify classes in components
- **SASS Variables**: Add to `assets/scss/main.scss`
- **Tailwind Config**: Extend theme in `tailwind.config.ts`

## 🔧 TypeScript

All types are defined in `types/astro.ts`:

- `City` - City location data
- `Planet` - Planet configuration
- `ZodiacSign` - Zodiac sign data
- `AstroLine` - Astrocartography line
- `NatalPosition` - Natal chart position
- `Transit` - Current transit
- `FuturePrediction` - Future prediction
- `CityMatch` - City power match
- `AstroData` - Complete astrology data

## ⚡ Performance

- Three.js lazy-loaded for optimal bundle size
- Pixel ratio capped at 2x for mobile performance
- Animation frame cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Optimized re-renders with Vue's reactivity
- Static site generation support with `nuxt generate`

## 📝 License

This project is open source and available for personal use.

## 🎉 Improvements Over React Version

1. **Better Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration
2. **Cleaner Code** - Vue Composition API is more concise
3. **Better Performance** - Nuxt 3's optimizations
4. **SSR/SSG Support** - Can be server-rendered or statically generated
5. **Bug Fixes** - All form submission issues resolved
6. **SASS Support** - Better stylesheet organization
7. **Auto-imports** - Components and composables auto-imported

## 🐛 Debugging Notes

The original React version had these issues that were fixed:

1. **Form Submission**: Changed from React's `onSubmit` to Vue's `@submit.prevent`
2. **City Selection**: Uses Vue's v-model instead of React useState
3. **Lifecycle**: Proper Vue lifecycle hooks (onMounted, onUnmounted)
4. **Reactivity**: Uses ref() and computed() for reactive state
5. **Icon Library**: Uses Nuxt Icon instead of lucide-react
