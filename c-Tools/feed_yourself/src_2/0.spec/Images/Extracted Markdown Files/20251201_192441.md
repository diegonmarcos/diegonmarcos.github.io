Banana bread
Ingredients:
•
2 cups mashed bananas (about 4)
1/2 cup sugar
1⁄2 cup melted butter or vegetable oil
2 large eggs (or the equivalent of 2 flax/ chia eggs to make the recipe vegan)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
11⁄2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (not needed, but strongly recommended)
1⁄2 cup chocolate chips (not needed, but strongly recommended)
Method:
Preheat the oven to 180°C and grease a pan.
In a large bowl, whisk together the mashed banana, sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Don't overmix. Fold in the 1/2 cup walnuts and chocolate chips.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and top with more walnuts and sliced banana. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a fork inserted comes out clean and the top springs back to the touch.
