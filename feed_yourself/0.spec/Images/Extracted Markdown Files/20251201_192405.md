# Alei Gefen (Stuffed Grape Leaves)

> The art of rolling tiny parcels of lemony, herby rice in delicate grape leaves. Tedious? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely. Your grandma would be proud (or extremely critical, depending on the grandma).

*Quantities depend on how many leaves you have - scale as needed*

## Ingredients

### Grape Leaves
- Vine leaves (canned: wash well to remove saltiness; fresh: blanch in boiling water for a few seconds)

### Filling
- Rice
- Tomatoes, cut into small cubes
- Onion, cut into small cubes (ratio: 4 tomatoes per onion)
- 1 bundle mint
- 1 bundle parsley
- Juice of at least 1 lemon
- Salt to taste
- Olive oil

### Sauce
- Water (enough to cover)
- Lemon juice
- Salt
- Olive oil
- Sliced tomatoes (for pot bottom)

## Instructions

1. Mix all filling ingredients together
2. Cut off the stem (chopchik) of each leaf - it's not tasty
3. Place leaf with the veiny/bumpy side facing UP
4. Add MUCH LESS filling than you think - rice expands!
5. Roll tightly: fold sides in, then roll from bottom to top
6. Arrange sliced tomatoes on the bottom of a pot with olive oil
7. Pack the rolled leaves VERY tightly on top of tomatoes (so they don't open)
8. Pour sauce over everything
9. Place a plate on top to weight them down
10. Bring to boil on high heat
11. Reduce to low heat and cook until done
