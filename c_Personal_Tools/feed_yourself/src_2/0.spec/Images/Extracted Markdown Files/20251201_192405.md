Alei Gefen (Grape leaves)
(The most basic recipe, quantities depend on how many leaves you have)
Ingredients:
Vine leaves - if you use canned ones, wash well with cold water to refine the saltiness. If using fresh leaves, you should cook them in boiling water for a few seconds.
Ingredients for the filling:
Rice
Tomatoes cut into small cubes
onion cut into small cubes (for each onion, about four tomatoes)
A bundle of mint
A bundle of parsley
Juice of at least one lemon
salt to taste
Olive oil
Ingredients for the filling:
• water (to cover all the fillings)
Method:
lemon juice
Salt
Olive oil
sliced tomatoes
Mix all the filling ingredients. You should cut the chopchik of the leaves because it is not tasty.
Let's start with the work of rolling, it is important that the side with the protrusions of the leaf is towards you, i.e. upwards. You should put much less filling than you think, because the rice expands during cooking.
We will arrange the tomato slices in the bottom of a pot with a little olive oil, and on them we will begin to crowd the vine leaves. It is important that they are really tight so that they do not open during cooking. Pour the sauce on top, and place a plate on top, you should put pressure on the stuffing.
We will transfer the pot to the stove, first on high heat and after boiling we will reduce it to low heat. We will cook what is ready.
