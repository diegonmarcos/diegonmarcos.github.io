Bake in oven at 150°C fan forced for 1hr to 1hr10 until golden and cooked through Leave the cheesecake in the oven for a further 15 mins with the oven turned off and the door ajar. This gets the cake to sink in the middle so you can pour the berry goodness on top.
Let cheesecake cool completely and refrigerate for at least 2 hrs, but this cake is 100x better if you refrigerate overnight
