Sunflower seeds (roast in pan with a little bit of olive oil)
Pumpkin seeds

Sauce ingredients (put in good jar and shake well to mix until sugar dissolves):
• Roughly 1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 soy sauce
1/3 white vinegar
•
1-2 tbsp sugar (to taste)
Method:
Roast (likloah) the seeds in a frying pan, INDIVIDUALLY (so that the different seeds
