# Laudae's Cheese and Onion Pie

> A cheesy, buttery hug in pie form. The crispy pastry meets gooey filling in the most comforting way possible. Perfect for feeding a crowd or just yourself (no judgment).

**Serves:** 20 people

## Ingredients

### Pastry
- 250g butter, cubed
- 1/2 bag flour (eyeball it)
- 1 egg
- Milk (to double the egg volume)

### Filling
- 2 average sized potatoes
- 2 average sized onions
- 1kg grated cheese (cheddar recommended)
- 2 tsp mustard
- 25-50g butter
- Salt and pepper

## Instructions

### Make the Pastry
1. Cube butter and put in bowl with flour
2. Smoosh together with fingers until it creates a "squishy mess" or "textured entity"
3. Whisk egg in a measuring cup, then double the liquid with milk
4. Add to flour-butter mix and combine with your hands
5. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour (longer is better)

### Make the Filling
1. Cut onion and potatoes into 1cm cubes (important!)
2. Grease a heavy pan with lots of butter
3. Cook potatoes and onions on lowest heat with lid on for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally
4. Let mixture cool to room temperature (5-10 minutes)
5. Add mustard, generous salt and pepper, and cheese
6. Mix nicely - cheese shouldn't fully melt, just clump together

### Assemble and Bake
1. Take pastry out of fridge, split 2/3 for base and 1/3 for lid
2. Grease dish, roll out base pastry, line the dish with edges peeking over
3. Add filling
4. Roll out lid and cover pie completely
5. Pinch edges together and press with fork all around
6. Egg wash the top
7. Bake at 180°C for 20-30 minutes
