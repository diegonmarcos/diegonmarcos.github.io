Create distinctive, production-grade frontends avoiding "AI aesthetics". Process: Purpose --> Tone (pick extreme: brutalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, etc.) --> Constraints --> Differentiation. Avoid: Inter/Roboto, purple gradients, predictable layouts.

The skill enforces a deliberate design process that starts with understanding the project's purpose, then selects a strong visual tone rather than defaulting to safe, generic choices. Typography must be distinctive -- no fallback to overused system fonts. Motion design should be intentional with orchestrated reveals and micro-interactions. Backgrounds use gradient meshes, noise textures, or geometric patterns instead of flat solid colors.

## Example

- "Design a brutalist landing page for a developer portfolio with monospace typography and harsh grid lines"
- "Create a retro-futuristic dashboard with CRT scan-line effects, neon accent colors, and a dark bitmap font"
- "Build a maximalist product page with layered parallax sections, bold serif headings, and textured grain overlays"
- "Design a minimal Japanese-inspired homepage with vertical text flow, generous whitespace, and ink-wash backgrounds"
