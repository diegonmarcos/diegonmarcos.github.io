## Instructions

### Prepare the Filling
1. Mix orange, black and green lentils with rice, wash several times
2. Soak in cold water for 30 minutes (they'll double in volume)
3. Fry onions in a large pan for about 8 minutes
4. Drain lentils and rice, add to the pan
5. Add spices: cumin, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg, salt, pepper
6. Add tomato cubes, herbs, and crushed garlic
7. Fry and mix, taste and adjust seasoning
8. Squeeze in half a lemon - filling is ready!

### Prepare the Vegetables
1. Spread olive oil over the base of a wide, flat pot
2. Arrange cherry tomatoes nicely on the bottom
3. Spread onion half-circles over tomatoes
4. Sprinkle salt, pepper, brown sugar, and thyme
5. Cut eggplants in half, keeping the stem
6. Mark and hollow out with a spoon

### Assemble and Cook
1. Fill the eggplant bellies with filling
2. Place on the tomato layer
3. Pour sauce (olive oil + lemon juice + water) to reach middle of eggplants - don't cover them
4. Fill any extra peppers or vegetables with leftover filling
5. Cover pot, bring to boil on high heat
6. Reduce to low heat, cook 40 minutes
7. Transfer covered pot to oven at 180°C for 1.5 hours
8. Add more water if needed before putting in oven
9. Remove lid and crank heat to maximum for 15 minutes ("heat stroke" for golden tops!)
