# Basic Pie Dough

> The foundation of all great pies - flaky, buttery, and surprisingly easy. Master this dough and you'll have friends begging for your pies. Works with sweet or savory fillings.

**Yield:** One round pan

## Ingredients

- 200g flour (about 1.5 cups minus a tablespoon)
- 100g very cold butter, cut into cubes
- A little salt
- 1 egg
- 2-3 tablespoons cold water

## Instructions

1. Crumble butter together with flour and salt until you get a sand-like texture (food processor works great for this)
2. Work the dough as little as possible - we don't want to melt the butter!
3. Add the egg and water gradually (amount varies with weather and flour)
4. Knead just a little until a uniform ball forms
5. Flour a surface, roll out the dough
6. Transfer to a pan greased with butter
7. Line the dough nicely inside the mold, including corners, and press to the sides
8. Pierce the bottom with a fork
9. Put in the freezer for at least 30 minutes
10. For crispy results: Pre-bake at 180°C for 15-20 minutes until lightly golden
11. Add your chosen filling and continue baking as needed

*Tip: Pre-baking (blind baking) keeps the dough crispy even with wet fillings!*
