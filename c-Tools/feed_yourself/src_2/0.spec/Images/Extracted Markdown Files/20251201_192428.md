Ingredients:
2 medium egg plants
•
2 medium cloves of garlic
DIPS
George's Babaganush
2 tbsp lemon juice
• 1⁄4 cup tahini
1⁄2 cup olive oil (a little more for brushing the eggplant and for garnish)\
2 tbsp parsley
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cumin
Pinch of smoked paprika
Method:
Heat the oven to 230°C and place halved eggplants on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Brush the cut sides with olive oil, and place that side down on the pan. Roast the eggplant for about 35-40 mins and then set aside to cool for a few mins. Then, scoop out the middle and leave the skin behind.
Use a mesh strainer, and mash the eggplant until all of the liquid comes out of it.
Put the eggplant in a bowl and add the garlic and lemon. Mix with a fork until the eggplant breaks down. Add the tahini and stir until all is combined. Slowly add in the olive oil.
Stir until the mixture is pale and creamy. Then, add in the salt, cumin and parsley. Season with more salt and lemon juice.
Serve with olive oil, parsley and paprika on top
