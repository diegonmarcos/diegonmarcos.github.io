Method:
Put the peppers in an oven preheated to 220 degrees Celsius for about half an hour or until you see roasted areas (sometimes you need to turn them after fifteen minutes). After allowing them to cool, clean the peppers from seeds.
At the same time, we can mix all the other ingredients in a bowl.
We will put all our friends in the blender, taste and if necessary we will adjust the dressing.
